### To do
- [ ] Add a copr package for progl and provide the bash completions for the same. 
  REFERENCE: https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree/PKGBUILD?h=amdgpu-pro-installer
- [ ] Add an option for Installing the AMD Proprietary Drivers to the system using the repository available. This should be the recommended option as it will update with new releases. Fix the ldconfig to use mesa by default instead of amdgpu for OpenGL. Make a dnf post-transaction actions to fix this problem when the package updates and overwrites the changes.
